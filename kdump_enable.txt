To configure kdump to write core files to the /var/crash directory on local disk, you will first need to install the kexec-tools package:

$ yum install kexec-tools

Once the package is installed, you will need to add a crashkernel line to the kernel boot arguments.
This line contains the amount of memory to reserve for the crashkernel, and should look similar to the following 
(you may need to increase the amount of memory depending on the platform you are using):

title CentOS (2.6.18-128.el5)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-128.el5 ro root=LABEL=/ console=ttyS0 \
                   crashkernel=128M@16M
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.18-128.el5.img



To allow you to get a core file if a box hangs, you can enable sysrq magic key sequences by setting “kernel.sysrq” to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf 
(you can also use the sysctl “-w” option to enable this feature on an active host):

kernel.sysrq = 1

Once these settings are in place, you can enable the kdump service with the chkconfig and service commands:

$ chkconfig kdump on

$ service kdump start

If you want to verify that kdump is working, you can type “alt + sysrq + c” on the console, or echo a “c” character to the sysrq-trigger proc entry:

$ echo “c” > /proc/sysrq-trigger

SysRq : Trigger a crashdump
Linux version 2.6.18-128.el5 (mockbuild@builder10.centos.org)
….

This will force a panic, which should result in a core file being generated in the /var/crash directory:

$ pwd
/var/crash/2009-07-05-18:31

$ ls -la
total 317240
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 5 18:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jul 5 18:31 ..
-r——– 1 root root 944203448 Jul 5 18:32 vmcore

If you are like me and prefer to be notified when a box panics, you can configure your log monitoring solution to look for the string 
“kdump: saved a vmcore” in /var/log/messages:

Jul 5 18:32:08 kvmnode1 kdump: saved a vmcore to /var/crash/2009-07-05-18:31

Kdump is pretty sweet, and it’s definitely one of those technologies that every RAS savy engineer should be 
configuring on each server he or she deploys.
