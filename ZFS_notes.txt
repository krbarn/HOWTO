If a ZFS mountpoint contains data, ZFS will not mount a dataset on that mountpoint.

The system will stop in single user mode.   Networking is not enabled in single user mode, 
so the server will be unavailable, except from the console.

If you can access the console, run "zfs mount -a" to test for ZFS mount errors

The prevent this problem from happening in the future MIS must test to see if the ZFS dataset is 
mounted before writing to the mountpoint

zpool status will give you the status of ZFS
