Step 1: Gain root access to your server using SSH.

Step 2: Check whether the quota package is install or otherwise please install it before continue.
rpm -qa|grep quota

Step 3: Modify /etc/fstab file

Partitions that you have not yet enabled quota normally look something like:

/dev/hda5 /home ext3 default 1 2

To enable user quota support for that partition, simply add in usrquota next to default such as below:

/dev/hda5 /home ext3 default,usrquota 1 2

To enable group quota, just add grpquota.
To enable both user and group quotas, add in both usrquota,grpquota.

Step 4: Reboot or Not to Reboot.

Normally I won't reboot, you can try this command on the partition that you have modified or added in quota support:
mount -o remount /home

Step 5: Quota Check

/sbin/quotacheck -cguvamf -F vfsv0

Step 6: Rerun Quota Check for old version

/sbin/quotacheck -cguvamf -F vfsold

Step 7: Turn on Quotas

/sbin/quotaon -a

To see the report of quotas, issue this command:

repquota -a

To set a user quota, issue the following command:
setquota -u USERNAME SOFTQUOTA HARDQUOTA SOFTFILELIMIT HARDFILELIMIT -a
Where:
USERNAME is the user
SOFTQUOTA in kilobytes
HARDQUOTA in kilobytes
SOFTFILELIMIT set it to 0 normally
HARDFILELIMIT set it to 0 also

mount -o remount / ; /sbin/quotacheck -cguvamf -F vfsv0 ; /sbin/quotacheck -cguvamf -F vfsold ; /sbin/quotaon -a ; repquota -a
