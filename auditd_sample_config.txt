So making those rather large assumptions, and focusing on the production system, we can get down to work.
Looking at the auditd recommendation in the CIS benchmark for RHEL5 we can start building out the following suggested ruleset:


# This file contains the auditctl rules that are loaded
# whenever the audit daemon is started via the initscripts.
# The rules are simply the parameters that would be passed
# to auditctl.

# First rule - delete all
-D

# Increase the buffers to survive stress events.
# Make this bigger for busy systems
-b 2048

-a exit,always -S unlink -S rmdir
-a exit,always -S stime.*
-a exit,always -S setrlimit.*
-w /etc/group -p wa
-w /etc/passwd -p wa
-w /etc/shadow -p wa
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa

# Disable adding any additional rules - note that adding *new* rules will require a reboot
