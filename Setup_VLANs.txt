The configuration of VLANs under FC/RHEL/CentOS is something that I always end up looking in the “ifup” script and 
experimenting around with. This is made worse by there being two different conventions that can be used for the 
interface naming. Here’s how I set up VLANs. 

First of all, the base interface needs to be configured. Usually, it’s already got at least a stub file, 
which needs to be modified to have the following elements:

DEVICE=eth0                   #  use real interface name here
BOOTPROTO=static
HWADDR=AA:17:31:9C:8D:BC      #  use real MAC address here
ONBOOT=no
TYPE=Ethernet
IPADDR=0.0.0.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0

In this example, I am configuring the device “eth0? (the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0?, 
with the MAC address of “AA:17:31:9C:8D:BC”. You will need to plug in your system’s values for these two lines, 
and the rest should be left the same.

The other method for naming is “eth0.X” which has the benefit that you don’t have to specify the interface name 
in the ifcfg script. Also, since VLAN interfaces are named based on the physical interface, you can have different 
VLAN name-spaces. In other words, eth0.5 may be a different network than eth1.5. However, VLAN IDs have a name-space 
of up to 4096, so unless you’re dealing with multiple networks outside of your control, you can (and should) probably 
use a non-overlapping VLAN name-space.

The draw-back is that /etc/sysctl.conf interprets the “.” in the name as meaning a “/” in the /proc heirarchy, 
which breaks things like “net.ipv4.conf.eth0.5.forwarding = 1?.

To configure “eth0.5?, write a “/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.5? file with:

VLAN=yes
DEVICE=eth0.5
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=Ethernet
IPADDR=10.254.5.254
NETMASK=255.255.255.0

This is the same as for “vlan5? above, but the “PHYSDEV” and “VLAN_NAME_TYPE” lines may be omitted.

The only way I could get a single NIC (unbonded) working, was to create a VLAN-tagged configuration. 
So, I had eth0 with no configuration details really, and then eth0.123 (where 123 is the VLAN tag) which did have details like 
IP address, netmask, etc. That configuration worked fine. So, I figured the same sort of configuration should be leveraged with 
the bonded interface. My question is, do I create a VLAN-tagged bond configuration with regular ethX configurations, or 
VLAN-tagged ethX configurations bonded to a non-VLAN-tagged bond configuration.

Here it how to do it:

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/eth0

DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=some MAC address
TYPE=Ethernet
UUID=some device ID
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/eth1

DEVICE=eth1
HWADDR=some MAC address
TYPE=Ethernet
UUID=some device ID
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/bond0

DEVICE=bond0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
TYPE=Ethernet
USERCTL=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BONDING_OPTS="mode4 miimon=100"

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/bond0.123

DEVICE=bond0.123
IPADDR=10.x.y.50
NETMASK=255.255.254.0
GATEWAY=10.x.y.1
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
USERCTL=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no
TYPE=Ethernet
VLAN=yes
