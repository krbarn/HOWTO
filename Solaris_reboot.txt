Reboot
If you are trying to reboot the system as opposed to turning it off, you could use:

    shutdown -y -i6 -g0

Or:

    sync;sync;init 6

Or even:

    reboot

Shutdown
You have more than one command option that you can use. The best command is this, executed as root:

    shutdown -y -i5 -g0

This will immediately shut the system down. You can also use the older command that still works:

    sync;sync;init 5

You can even use:

    poweroff
