* ls -l /dev/sd?

note which hard disks are already attached to this server

* add hard disk to the VM

* the new disk will hotplug into the system, so running "ls -l /dev/sd?" will show the new disk

* fdisk the new disk to create the full partition device /dev/sdX1, where X is the drive letter

* pvcreate /dev/sdX1 # to make the disk available to LVM

* vgextend /dev/VolGRoupXX /dev/sdX1

* determine the logical volume the file system is mounted on 
   - df /mountpoint
   - grep mountpoint /etc/fstab


* lvextend --size +NNNG /dev/VolGroup0X/LogVol0X  # where NNN is the number of GB to extend the file system by and X is a number

* resize2fs /dev/VolGRoup0X/LogVol0X # where VolGroup0X LogVol0X are from the df command
