If you have a failed disk in DL XXX series servers do the following

First, gather information for HP so they will send you a new disk

1.	Get on the webconsole, find the disk inventory (if available, depends on ilo version) and take a screen shot of it
2.	Logon to the server and run 

# /usr/sbin/hpacucli
set target ctrl slot=0
pd all show

and get the results.

3.	Run hpaducli –f /tmp/hostname.zip  to generate a disk wear report  to be emailed to HP

Now that you have the supporting documentation for HP, swap out the disk with a spare

4.	Open up a case using HP’s website
5.	Attach the snapshots and zip file to the case via email
6.	Have hp just deliver you a space next day, tell them no need to send out a repair man


That’s about it
