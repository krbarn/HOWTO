Once per hour, we use an LVM snapshot to backup a MySQL database. The
procedure is:
1. mysql server: flush tables with read lock; hold this lock until step 5
2. sync
3. lvcreate --extents N --snapshot --name dbsnapshotlv /dev/datavg/datalv
4. mount -o ro /dev/datavg/dbsnapshotlv /mnt/snapshot
5. mysql server: unlock tables
6. create backup of /mnt/snapshot
7. umount /mnt/snapshot && lvremove /dev/datavg/dbsnapshotlv


# lvcreate -L500M -s -n dbbackup /dev/ops/databases
lvcreate -- WARNING: the snapshot must be disabled if it gets full

If the snapshot logical volume becomes full it will be dropped (become unusable) 
so it is vitally important to allocate enough space. The amount of space necessary 
is dependent on the usage of the snapshot, so there is no set recipe to follow for this. 

If the snapshot size equals the origin size, it will never overflow.
