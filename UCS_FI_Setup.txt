Before configuring the FIs, you will need to come up with the following information.

 System Name

    NOTE: This is the hostname for the cluster.  Each FI will also automatically be assigned a name based on the system name
    with an A or B appended depending on which FI you are working with.

 Password for the admin account

 3 Static IP addresses will need to be obtained for the FIs.

   1 will be for each FI and the 3rd will be the virtual IP for the cluster.
 
 Subnet mask for management network

 Default Gateway

 Domain name

Using a laptop, connect the serial port of the laptop to the serial port on the primary FI. This would be the fabric interconnect 
that you designate as fabric A.

After you power on the FI, you should be prompted after a few minutes to enter some information.

 Example:

          ---- Basic System Configuration Dialog ----

 This setup utility will guide you through the basic configuration of
 the system. Only minimal configuration including IP connectivity to
 the Fabric interconnect and its clustering mode is performed through these steps.

 Type Ctrl-C at any time to abort configuration and reboot system.
 To back track or make modifications to already entered values,
 complete input till end of section and answer no when prompted
 to apply configuration.


 Enter the configuration method. (console/gui) ? console

 Enter the setup mode; setup newly or restore from backup. (setup/restore) ? setup

 You have chosen to setup a new Fabric interconnect. Continue? (y/n): y

 Enforce strong password? (y/n) [y]: n
 
 Enter the password for "admin":
 Confirm the password for "admin":
 
 Is this Fabric interconnect part of a cluster(select 'no' for standalone)? (yes/no) [n]: yes
 
 Enter the switch fabric (A/B) []: A

 Enter the system name:  ucsasp01

 Physical Switch Mgmt0 IPv4 address : 10.10.2.154

 Physical Switch Mgmt0 IPv4 netmask : 255.255.0.0

 IPv4 address of the default gateway : 10.10.0.1

 Cluster IPv4 address : 10.10.2.153

 Configure the DNS Server IPv4 address? (yes/no) [n]: y

 DNS IPv4 address : 10.16.149.6

 Configure the default domain name? (yes/no) [n]: y

   Default domain name : unx.sas.com

 Following configurations will be applied:

   Switch Fabric=A
   System Name=ucsasp01
   Enforced Strong Password=no
   Physical Switch Mgmt0 IP Address=10.10.2.154
   Physical Switch Mgmt0 IP Netmask=255.255.0.0
   Default Gateway=10.10.0.1
   DNS Server=10.16.149.6
   Domain Name=unx.sas.com

   Cluster Enabled=yes
   Cluster IP Address=10.10.2.153
   NOTE: Cluster IP will be configured only after both Fabric Interconnects are initialized

 Apply and save the configuration (select 'no' if you want to re-enter)? (yes/no): yes
 

 Wait for a couple of minutes and move to the next step.
 This could take 10-15 minutes!!

Now connect the console connection to the secondary FI on fabric B and power on

 Enter the configuration method. (console/gui) ? console

 Installer has detected the presence of a peer Fabric interconnect. This Fabric interconnect will be added to the cluster.
 Continue (y/n) ? y

 Enter the admin password of the peer Fabric interconnect:
   Connecting to peer Fabric interconnect... done
   Retrieving config from peer Fabric interconnect... done
   Peer Fabric interconnect Mgmt0 IP Address: 10.10.2.154
   Peer Fabric interconnect Mgmt0 IP Netmask: 255.255.0.0
   Cluster IP address          : 10.10.2.153

 Physical Switch Mgmt0 IPv4 address : 10.10.2.155                    # NOTE: This can take a very long time up to 15 minutes if 
                                                                     #       the existing has been configured for a while and in use.  

 Apply and save the configuration (select 'no' if you want to re-enter)? (yes/no): yes
 Applying configuration. Please wait.

 Configuration file - Ok

At this point, the UCS manager should be operational. From a web browser, you should be able to connect to the 
cluster hostname ( system name ) and go through the rest of the setup.
